        <strong>Dynamic ("normal") </strong> - it is necessary to warm up
        necessarily. Moreover, the larger the diameter of the membrane and the
        stronger the material, the longer the heating is needed.

        It makes no sense to <strong> warm the armature "plugs" </strong>.
        Another technology. If you do not go into details, there is nothing to
        “develop” in the armature. But many rebar sound neophytes report warming
        up after a few days or a week of use. This is just the same “warming up
        the brain”. If you switch from a dynamic sound to an armature sound,
        then it takes some time to just get used to it. He is very different.
        Here's the warm-up: it's not the sound that changes, but the owner gets
        used to the new pitch.

        <strong>Planar</strong> - Isodynamics in theory is affected by heating.
        But it doesn't feel that much. I would not specifically heat them up,
        only if you want to be sure of their sound (which is worth the money).
        And so - in the process will be developed. 😎

       <strong> Electrostats</strong> - Purposefully warming them, as far as I know, does not make
        much sense. They need to be warmed up at the beginning of each listening
        session. When you put on “cold” ones, you listen to a composition, then
        put them aside, something plays there for 15-30 minutes, then you listen
        to the same composition ... It sounds noticeably different.
